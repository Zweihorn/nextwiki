## The Project

Please be aware this is an overtake fork of the [original DokuWiki Open Source Wiki Engine](https://github.com/dokuwiki/dokuwiki) as 
a new project dedicated to [EUPL](https://github.com/Zweihorn/Zweihorn/blob/main/MAINTAINER.md) and future integration with Nextcloud if feasable.
There is no guarantee this project will ever reach this quite ambitious goals but big things have small beginnings. Foremost this is a 
[FOSS project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
and a personal life long learning project for an old coding cowboy like myself becoming more familiar with git besides other things.

Time will tell.
